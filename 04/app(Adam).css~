/*
    There are only 147 color in CSS.
    The basic ones are really used that often. Usually for Debugging purposes.
    Wesite for view those 147 colors in CSS: http://colours.neilorangepeel.com/

    Here are ways to add any color you want! (Use online color pickers. Max out is white. Min is Back)

    Using Hexdecimal (Base 16!): # plus a string of 6 digits that consist of 0-F.
    (First 2 digit determine how much red, Second 2 Green, Third 2 Blue)

    Using RGB (Base 10): rgb plus (0, 255, 0) [Red, Green, Blue]
    (Range from 0-225.

    Using RGBA: Like RGB but has a 4th catagory. Ranges from 0.0-1.0 and Determines Transparency! 
    (Max/1 is normal and Min/0 is nothing)

/*
    Border Basics: All CSS borders need the color, width, and style defined!
    Rather than use all three lines of code,
    you can just use the border element and define the width, style, and color!
